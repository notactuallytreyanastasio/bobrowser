# HN For Mac OS

We have a nice reader for HN here

It gets the top 25 stories

It presents the titles of them in a dropdown from the system bar at the top of Mac OS

The Icon for it is the letters "HN"

It will simply use the HN API to get the stories to title and link to

Clicking the link opens the comments, not the story's actual link
