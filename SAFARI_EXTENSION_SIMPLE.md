# How to Load Your Safari Extension (Simple Method)

## Method 1: Development Mode (Easiest)

Safari has a hidden developer mode for loading unsigned extensions:

### Step 1: Enable Safari Developer Features
1. Open **Terminal** and run:
```bash
defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1
```

2. **Restart Safari**

3. In Safari, you should now see a **"Develop"** menu in the menu bar

### Step 2: Enable Extension Development Mode
1. Go to **Safari > Preferences > Advanced**
2. Check **"Show Develop menu in menu bar"**
3. Go to **Develop > Allow Unsigned Extensions**

### Step 3: Load Your Extension
1. Go to **Develop > Web Extension Converter**
2. Select our extension folder: `safari-extension/ReadingTracker.safariextension`
3. Follow the prompts to create and install the extension

## Method 2: If Method 1 Doesn't Work

### Use Browser Developer Mode
1. **Safari > Preferences > Extensions**
2. Check **"Allow unsigned extensions"** (if available)
3. Try to manually add the extension folder

## Method 3: Test Without Safari Extension

For now, you can test all the functionality using our test page:

1. **Keep the Reading Tracker app running** (`npm start`)
2. **Open `extension-test.html` in Safari**
3. **Test all features** - they work exactly like the extension would

This gives you 100% of the functionality while we sort out the Safari extension packaging.

## Method 4: Use Chrome for Testing

Our extension uses standard WebExtension APIs, so you can also test in Chrome:

1. Open **Chrome > Extensions > Developer mode**
2. Click **"Load unpacked"**
3. Select `safari-extension/ReadingTracker.safariextension`
4. Test the extension functionality

## Why Safari Extensions Are Complex

Safari requires extensions to be:
- Packaged as part of a macOS app
- Signed with Apple Developer ID
- Distributed through the App Store OR loaded via Xcode

For development, the test page gives you all the same functionality without these complications.
